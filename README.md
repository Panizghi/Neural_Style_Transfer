# Neural Style Transfer

The term “style transfer” is used to describe the operation of recomposing one image in the style of another (group of) image(s). In general, this requires two inputs: content image(s) and style image(s). The technique applied should then produce output whose “content” mirrors the content image and whose “style” resembles that of the style image.
